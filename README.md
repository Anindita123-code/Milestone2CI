# Milestone 2 Project
# Nordics Art Galleria Search

## Overview :
The Nordic Arts Galleria Search is a search site for the Art Galleries of Nordic Countries namely
Ã…land, Denmark, Norway, Greenland, Faroe Island, Finland and Sweden. This site helps its users to filter by Country Name and display the Art gallery and Museums as a list, that are at a radius of 5000 from the marked latitude and longitudes for the respective countries.
The users can then select from one or more results from the filtered list of Art Galleries using the heart and add these to a wishlist. The selected items from the index page can be viewed in the wishlist page and optionally can be emailed to the email address that is provided by the user.

## UX:
This project aims to fulfil the user stories as mentioned below
1. As a user, I should be able to have a short overview of the site and when I view it.
2. As a user, I should be able to filter by country name and display the locations of the galleries on the map.
3. As a user, I should be able to see the Names, Addresses and the status of the marked location on the map.
4. As a user, I should be able to add one or more galleries to my wishlist.
5. As a user, I should be able to view my wishlist
6. As a user, I should be able to clear my wishlist
7. As a user, I should be able to delete individual wishlist items.
8. As a user, I should be able to have the wishlist emailed to me at a specified valid, email address.
