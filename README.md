# Milestone 2 Project

# Nordics Art Galleria Search

## Overview :
The Nordic Arts Galleria Search is a search site for the Art Galleries of Nordic Countries namely
Ã…land, Denmark, Norway, Greenland, Faroe Island, Finland and Sweden. This site helps its users to filter by Country Name and display the Art gallery and Museums as a list, that are at a radius of 5000 from the marked latitude and longitudes for the respective countries.
The users can then select from one or more results from the filtered list of Art Galleries using the corresponding heart button and add these to a wishlist. The selected items from the Home page can be viewed in the My Wishlist page and optionally can be emailed to the email address that is provided by the user.

## UX:
This project aims to fulfil the user stories as mentioned below
1. As a user, I should be able to understand what the site offers. 
2. As a user, I should be able to filter by any of the specified Nordic country and display the locations of the galleries on the google map UI.
3. As a user, I should be able to see a little more details (viz Names, Addresses and the status) of the selected and marked locations on the google map for each country.
4. As a user, I should be able to select each gallery / Museum listed on the right / below and add them to a wishlist.
5. As a user, I should be able to clear my wishlist (all items together)
6. As a user, I should be able to view my wishlist of selected places using the corresponding heart button.
7. As a user, I should be able to delete individual wishlist items from the displayed list.
8. As a user, I should be able to send the wishlist to a pre-specified emailid.
9. As a user, I should be provided with necessary information and error messages (if any)
