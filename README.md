## Overview 
The Nordics Art Galleria Search is a search site for the Art Galleries of Nordic Countries namely
Ã…land, Denmark, Norway, Greenland, Faroe Island, Finland and Sweden. This site helps its users to filter by Country Name and display the Art gallery and Museums as a list, that are at a radius of 5000 from the marked latitude and longitudes for the respective countries.
The users can then select from one or more results from the filtered list of Art Galleries using the corresponding heart button and add these to a wishlist. The selected items from the Home page can be viewed in the My Wishlist page and optionally can be emailed to the email address that is provided by the user.

## User Experience 
This project aims to fulfil the user stories as mentioned below
1. As a user, I should be able to understand what the site offers. 
2. As a user, I should be able to filter by any of the specified Nordic country and display the locations of the galleries on the google map UI.
3. As a user, I should be able to see a little more details (viz Names, Addresses and the status) of the selected and marked locations on the google map for each country.
4. As a user, I should be able to select each gallery / Museum listed on the right / below and add them to a wishlist.
5. As a user, I should be able to clear my wishlist (all items together)
6. As a user, I should be able to view my wishlist of selected places using the corresponding heart button.
7. As a user, I should be able to delete individual wishlist items from the displayed list.
8. As a user, I should be able to send the wishlist to a pre-specified emailid.
9. As a user, I should be provided with necessary information and error messages (if any) 
10. As a user, I should be able to use the social links in the footer to connect the social media websites and contact the Nordic Galleria Search Team.

**Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section**

**I. As a user, I should be able to understand what the site offers.**

* On opening the site, there is a short description on the left, describing the intention of the site. There is a carousel on the right which can take the user through the Art Museums of 7 Nordic countries. The user can use the previous or next symbols or the dot notations underneath to scroll through the images.
    1. Working of the carousel - The image changes when clicking on the previous or next icons, and also on the dots below, It shows the number of images on the top left hand corner. - No errors detected in the working of the carousel, however there may be some issues with the picture quality, and i believe those can be overlooked.
    2. When the site loads for the first time, sometimes it shows an error for favicon.ico. There is no favicon used for the code and this is not generated by any of the code pages. Otherwise the site loads smoothly
    3. The design changes when the width is reduced to cater for iphone and tabs. For larger width, a thumbnail list of countries are displayed. This changes into a dropdown list in an iphone - Tested OK
    4. Initially there is no country selected, and hence nothing is highlighted, and the map is initialized to a wider view of all Nordic Countries. - Tested OK
    5. The social links in the footer are currently linked to their respective home pages, as there is no account created for this project separately - Tested OK
    6. The navbar has two options "Home" and "Wishlist" which are linked to the respective pages. The wishlist option, lists a dropdown for clearning the wishlist or routing it to the wishlist page  - Tested OK

**II. As a user, I should be able to filter by any of the specified Nordic country and display the locations of the galleries on the google map UI.**
    1. I am able to select the country name, from the list of countries(as a mobile user) or the list of thumbnails of the countries(as an ipad or laptop user), which then displays the country maps with the location markers specifying the Art Galleries and Museums of the country.

The marked locations are displayed to the right side of the map showing up their names, addresses and their current status. Beside each named location on the right is a heart button, which indicates that the place can be selected to add to users wishlist
    1. The location of each place is marked from A-Z such that, this is repeated if there more results - Tested OK
    2. The name, address and the status of the search results on the map, are displayed dynamically by creating new elements as per the number of search results and this is displayed in the form of a scrollable list - Tested OK
